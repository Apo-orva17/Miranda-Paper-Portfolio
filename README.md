This project is replica of the amazing  retro themed award winning Miranda Paper Portfolio.
Here I have used HTML, CSS and JS along with gsap and locomotive library.
In the very beginning is a very immersive animation made using gsap library, that gives this project a very unique charm by making it look a newspaper of old times.
Another key feature is added using the locomotive library that enables smooth scroll and very eye catching zoom in and zoom out effect.
