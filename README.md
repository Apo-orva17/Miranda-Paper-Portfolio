This project is replica of the amazing  retro themed award winning Miranda Paper Portfolio.
Here I have used HTML, CSS and JS along with gsap and locomotive library.
In the very beginning is a very immersive animation made using gsap library, which gives this project a unique charm by making it look like a newspaper of old times. Another key feature is added using the locomotive library that enables smooth scroll and a very eye-catching zoom-in and zoom-out effect.
